# Nzota Hotel — Landing Page

This is a simple landing page demo for Nzota Hotel with a blue & white theme.

Files:
- `index.html` — main page
- `css/styles.css` — styles
- `js/main.js` — carousel and small interactions
- `assets/` — place your `hero.jpg` or other images here

How to use:
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Place local images in `assets/` and use the following filenames for the demo: `hero.jpg`, `room1.jpg`, `room2.jpg`, `room3.jpg` (or update paths in the HTML/CSS).
3. Replace the image URLs inside the carousel slides with your hotel photos (they can be local files in `assets/` or remote links).

Notes:
- Carousel has keyboard support (left/right arrows), autoplay (4s), and pauses on hover.
- Contact form is a demo (no backend). It shows a success message when submitted; integrate with your API or mail handler as needed.
- Theme variables are in `css/styles.css` under `:root`.  
- The page includes an About, Services, Directions (map embed), and Contact section.
